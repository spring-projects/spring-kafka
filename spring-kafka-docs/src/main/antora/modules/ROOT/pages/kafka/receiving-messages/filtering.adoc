= Filtering Messages

In certain scenarios, such as rebalancing, a message that has already been processed may be redelivered.
The framework cannot know whether such a message has been processed or not.
That is an application-level function.
This is known as the https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/IdempotentReceiver.html[Idempotent Receiver] pattern and Spring Integration provides an {spring-integration-url}/handler-advice/idempotent-receiver.html[implementation] of it.

The Spring for Apache Kafka project also provides some assistance by means of the `FilteringMessageListenerAdapter` class, which can wrap your `MessageListener`.
This class takes an implementation of `RecordFilterStrategy` in which you implement the `filter` method to signal that a message is a duplicate and should be discarded.
This has an additional property called `ackDiscarded`, which indicates whether the adapter should acknowledge the discarded record.
It is `false` by default.

When you use `@KafkaListener`, set the `RecordFilterStrategy` (and optionally `ackDiscarded`) on the container factory so that the listener is wrapped in the appropriate filtering adapter.

In addition, a `FilteringBatchMessageListenerAdapter` is provided, for when you use a batch xref:kafka/receiving-messages/message-listeners.adoc[message listener].

IMPORTANT: The `FilteringBatchMessageListenerAdapter` is ignored if your `@KafkaListener` receives a `ConsumerRecords<?, ?>` instead of `List<ConsumerRecord<?, ?>>`, because `ConsumerRecords` is immutable.

Starting with version 2.8.4, you can override the listener container factory's default `RecordFilterStrategy` by using the `filter` property on the listener annotations.

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "filtered", topics = "topic", filter = "differentFilter")
public void listen(Thing thing) {
    ...
}
----

Starting with version 3.3, Ignoring empty batches that result from filtering by `RecordFilterStrategy` is supported.
When implementing `RecordFilterStrategy`, it can be configured through `ignoreEmptyBatch()`.
The default setting is `false`, indicating `KafkaListener` will be invoked even if all `ConsumerRecord` s are filtered out.

If `true` is returned, the `KafkaListener` [underline]#will not be invoked# when all `ConsumerRecord` are filtered out.
However, commit to broker, will still be executed.

If `false` is returned, the `KafkaListener` [underline]#will be invoked# when all `ConsumerRecord` are filtered out.

Here are some examples.

[source,java]
----
public class IgnoreEmptyBatchRecordFilterStrategy implements RecordFilterStrategy {
    ...
    @Override
    public List<ConsumerRecord<String, String>> filterBatch(
            List<ConsumerRecord<String, String>> consumerRecords) {
        return List.of();
    }

    @Override
    public boolean ignoreEmptyBatch() {
        return true;
    }
};

// NOTE: ignoreEmptyBatchRecordFilterStrategy is bean name of IgnoreEmptyBatchRecordFilterStrategy instance.
@KafkaListener(id = "filtered", topics = "topic", filter = "ignoreEmptyBatchRecordFilterStrategy")
public void listen(List<Thing> things) {
    ...
}
----
In this case, `IgnoreEmptyBatchRecordFilterStrategy` always returns empty list and return `true` as result of `ignoreEmptyBatch()`.
Thus `KafkaListener#listen(...)` never will be invoked at all.

[source,java]
----
public class NotIgnoreEmptyBatchRecordFilterStrategy implements RecordFilterStrategy {
    ...
    @Override
    public List<ConsumerRecord<String, String>> filterBatch(
            List<ConsumerRecord<String, String>> consumerRecords) {
        return List.of();
    }

    @Override
    public boolean ignoreEmptyBatch() {
        return false;
    }
};

// NOTE: notIgnoreEmptyBatchRecordFilterStrategy is bean name of NotIgnoreEmptyBatchRecordFilterStrategy instance.
@KafkaListener(id = "filtered", topics = "topic", filter = "notIgnoreEmptyBatchRecordFilterStrategy")
public void listen(List<Thing> things) {
    ...
}
----
However, in this case, `IgnoreEmptyBatchRecordFilterStrategy` always returns empty list and return `false` as result of `ignoreEmptyBatch()`.
Thus `KafkaListener#listen(...)` always will be invoked.
