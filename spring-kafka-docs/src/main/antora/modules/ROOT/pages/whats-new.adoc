:page-section-summary-toc: 1

This section covers the changes made from version 3.3 to version 4.0.
For changes in earlier versions, see xref:appendix/change-history.adoc[Change History].

[[x40-apache-kafka-4-0-upgrade]]
=== Apache Kafka 4.0 Client Upgrade

Spring for Apache Kafka has been upgraded to use Apache Kafka client version `4.0.0`.
This upgrade brings several important changes:

* All ZooKeeper-based functionality has been removed as Kafka 4.0 fully transitions to KRaft mode
* The ZooKeeper dependency has been removed from the project
* The embedded Kafka test framework now exclusively uses KRaft mode
* The `EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker` class has been removed, and all functionality is now handled by `EmbeddedKafkaKraftBroker`

[[x40-embedded-kafka-test-changes]]
=== Embedded Kafka Test Framework Changes

The test infrastructure has been significantly updated:

* The `EmbeddedKafkaRule` JUnit 4 rule has been removed
* The `@EmbeddedKafka` annotation has been simplified with the removal of ZooKeeper-related properties:
* The `kraft` property has been removed as KRaft mode is now the only option
* ZooKeeper-specific properties like `zookeeperPort`, `zkConnectionTimeout`, and `zkSessionTimeout` have been removed
* KafkaClusterTestKit imports now use new packages for KRaft mode
* Some tests have been updated to address limitations with static port assignments in KRaft mode
* Adjustments have been made to replication factors in tests to accommodate KRaft requirements

[[x40-consumer-records-constructor-changes]]
=== ConsumerRecords Constructor Changes

The `ConsumerRecords` constructor now requires an additional `Map` parameter, which has been addressed throughout the framework.
Applications that directly use this constructor will need to update their code.

[[x40-producer-interface-updates]]
=== Producer Interface Updates

New methods from the Kafka Producer interface have been implemented:

* `registerMetricForSubscription`
* `unregisterMetricFromSubscription`

[[x40-removed-deprecated-functionality]]
=== Removed Deprecated Functionality

Several deprecated items have been removed:

* The deprecated `partitioner` classes have been removed from runtime hints
* The deprecated `sendOffsetsToTransaction` method that used `String consumerGroupId` has been removed

[[x40-kafka-streams-updates]]
=== Kafka Streams API Changes

* `KafkaStreamBrancher` has been updated to use the new `split()` and `branch()` methods instead of the deprecated `branch()` method
* The `DeserializationExceptionHandler` has been updated to use the new `ErrorHandlerContext`

[[x40-internal-api-updates]]
=== Internal API Updates related to Apache Kafka 4.0.0

* The `BrokerAddress` class now uses `org.apache.kafka.server.network.BrokerEndPoint` instead of the deprecated `kafka.cluster.BrokerEndPoint`
* The `GlobalEmbeddedKafkaTestExecutionListener` has been updated to work solely with KRaft mode

[[x40-new-consumer-rebalance-protocol]]
=== New Consumer Rebalance Protocol

Spring for Apache Kafka 4.0 supports Kafka 4.0’s new consumer rebalance protocol - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-848%3A+The+Next+Generation+of+the+Consumer+Rebalance+Protocol[KIP-848].
For details, see xref:kafka/receiving-messages/rebalance-listeners.adoc#new-rebalance-protocol[New Consumer Rebalance Protocol docs].

[[x40-multi-value-header]]
=== Support multi-value header

The `JsonKafkaHeaderMapper` and `SimpleKafkaHeaderMapper` support multi-value header mapping for Kafka records.
More details are available in xref:kafka/headers.adoc#multi-value-header[Support multi-value header mapping].

[[x40-add-record-interceptor]]
=== Configure additional `RecordInterceptor`

Listener containers now support interceptor customization via `getRecordInterceptor()`.
See the xref:kafka/receiving-messages/message-listener-container.adoc#message-listener-container[Message Listener Containers] section for details.

[[x40-batch-observability]]
=== Per-Record Observation in Batch Listeners

It is now possible to get an observation for each record when using a batch listener.
See xref:kafka/micrometer.adoc#batch-listener-obs[Observability for Batch Listeners] for more information.

[[x40-kafka-queues]]
=== Kafka Queues (Share Consumer) Support

Spring for Apache Kafka now provides early access support for Kafka Queues through share consumers, which are part of Apache Kafka 4.0.0 and implement KIP-932.
This enables cooperative consumption where multiple consumers can consume from the same partitions simultaneously, providing better load distribution compared to traditional consumer groups.
See xref:kafka/kafka-queues.adoc[] for more information.

[[x40-jackson3-support]]
=== Jackson 3 Support

Spring for Apache Kafka now provides comprehensive support for Jackson 3 alongside existing Jackson 2 support.
Jackson 3 is automatically detected and preferred when available, providing enhanced performance and modern JSON processing capabilities.

All Jackson 2 classes now have Jackson 3 counterparts with consistent naming and improved type safety:

* `JsonKafkaHeaderMapper` replaces `DefaultKafkaHeaderMapper`
* `JacksonJsonSerializer/Deserializer` replaces `JsonSerializer/Deserializer`
* `JacksonJsonSerde` replaces `JsonSerde`
* `JacksonJsonMessageConverter` family replaces `JsonMessageConverter` family
* `JacksonProjectingMessageConverter` replaces `ProjectingMessageConverter`
* `DefaultJacksonJavaTypeMapper` replaces `DefaultJackson2JavaTypeMapper`

The new Jackson 3 classes use `JsonMapper` instead of generic `ObjectMapper` for enhanced type safety and leverage Jackson 3's improved module system and performance optimizations.

**Migration Path**: Existing applications continue to work unchanged with Jackson 2.
To migrate to Jackson 3, simply add Jackson 3 to your classpath and update class references to use the new Jackson 3 equivalents.
The framework automatically detects and prefers Jackson 3 when both versions are present.

**Backward Compatibility**: All Jackson 2 classes are deprecated but remain fully functional.
They will be removed in a future major version.

See xref:kafka/serdes.adoc[Serialization, Deserialization, and Message Conversion] for configuration examples.

[[x40-spring-retry-replacement]]
=== Spring Retry Dependency Removal

Spring for Apache Kafka has removed its dependency on Spring Retry in favor of the core retry support introduced in Spring Framework 7.
This is a breaking change that affects retry configuration and APIs throughout the framework.

`BackOffValuesGenerator` that generates the required `BackOff` values upfront, now works directly with Spring Framework's `BackOff` interface instead of `BackOffPolicy`.
These values are then managed by the listener infrastructure and Spring Retry is no longer involved.

From a configuration standpoint, Spring Kafka relied heavily on Spring Retry's `@Backoff` annotation.
As there is no equivalent in Spring Framework, the annotation has been moved to Spring Kafka as `@BackOff` with the following improvements:

* Harmonized naming: Uses `@BackOff` instead of `@Backoff` for consistency
* Expression evaluation: All string attributes support SpEL expressions and property placeholders
* Duration format support: String attributes accept `java.util.Duration` formats (e.g., "2s", "500ms")
* Enhanced documentation: Improved Javadoc with clearer explanations

Migration example:
[source,java]
----
// Before
@RetryableTopic(backoff = @Backoff(delay = 2000, maxDelay = 10000, multiplier = 2))

// After
@RetryableTopic(backOff = @BackOff(delay = 2000, maxDelay = 10000, multiplier = 2))

// With new duration format support
@RetryableTopic(backOff = @BackOff(delayString = "2s", maxDelayString = "10s", multiplier = 2))

// With property placeholders
@RetryableTopic(backOff = @BackOff(delayString = "${retry.delay}", multiplierString = "${retry.multiplier}"))
----

`RetryingDeserializer` no longer offers a `RecoveryCallback` but an equivalent function that takes `RetryException` as input.
This contains the exceptions thrown as well as the number of retry attempts:

[source,java]
----
// Before
retryingDeserializer.setRecoveryCallback(context -> {
    return fallbackValue;
});

// After
retryingDeserializer.setRecoveryCallback(retryException -> {
    return fallbackValue;
});
----

The use of `BinaryExceptionClassifier` has been replaced by the newly introduced `ExceptionMatcher`, which provides a polished API.

Additional changes include:

* `DestinationTopicPropertiesFactory` uses `ExceptionMatcher` instead of `BinaryExceptionClassifier`
* The `uniformRandomBackoff` method in `RetryTopicConfigurationBuilder` has been deprecated in favor of jitter support
* Error handling utilities have been updated to work with the new exception matching system
* Kafka Streams retry templates now use Spring Framework's retry support

Applications must update their configuration to use the new Spring Framework retry APIs, but the retry behavior and functionality remain the same.
