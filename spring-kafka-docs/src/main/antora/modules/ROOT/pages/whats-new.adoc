=== `@KafkaListener` Changes

The `@KafkaListener` annotation now supports an `ackMode` attribute, allowing individual listeners to override the container factory's default acknowledgment mode without creating separate container factory beans.
The attribute also supports SpEL expressions and property placeholders.
See xref:kafka/receiving-messages/listener-annotation.adoc[`@KafkaListener` Annotation] for more information.
