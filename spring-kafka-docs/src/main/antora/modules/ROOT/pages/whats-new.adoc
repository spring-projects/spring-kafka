:page-section-summary-toc: 1

This section covers the changes made from version 3.3 to version 4.0.
For changes in earlier versions, see xref:appendix/change-history.adoc[Change History].

[[x40-apache-kafka-4-0-upgrade]]
=== Apache Kafka 4.0 Client Upgrade

Spring for Apache Kafka has been upgraded to use Apache Kafka client version `4.0.0`.
This upgrade brings several important changes:

* All ZooKeeper-based functionality has been removed as Kafka 4.0 fully transitions to KRaft mode
* The ZooKeeper dependency has been removed from the project
* The embedded Kafka test framework now exclusively uses KRaft mode
* The `EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker` class has been removed, and all functionality is now handled by `EmbeddedKafkaKraftBroker`

[[x40-embedded-kafka-test-changes]]
=== Embedded Kafka Test Framework Changes

The test infrastructure has been significantly updated:

* The `EmbeddedKafkaRule` JUnit 4 rule has been removed
* The `@EmbeddedKafka` annotation has been simplified with the removal of ZooKeeper-related properties:
* The `kraft` property has been removed as KRaft mode is now the only option
* ZooKeeper-specific properties like `zookeeperPort`, `zkConnectionTimeout`, and `zkSessionTimeout` have been removed
* KafkaClusterTestKit imports now use new packages for KRaft mode
* Some tests have been updated to address limitations with static port assignments in KRaft mode
* Adjustments have been made to replication factors in tests to accommodate KRaft requirements

[[x40-consumer-records-constructor-changes]]
=== ConsumerRecords Constructor Changes

The `ConsumerRecords` constructor now requires an additional `Map` parameter, which has been addressed throughout the framework.
Applications that directly use this constructor will need to update their code.

[[x40-producer-interface-updates]]
=== Producer Interface Updates

New methods from the Kafka Producer interface have been implemented:

* `registerMetricForSubscription`
* `unregisterMetricFromSubscription`

[[x40-removed-deprecated-functionality]]
=== Removed Deprecated Functionality

Several deprecated items have been removed:

* The deprecated `partitioner` classes have been removed from runtime hints
* The deprecated `sendOffsetsToTransaction` method that used `String consumerGroupId` has been removed

[[x40-kafka-streams-updates]]
=== Kafka Streams API Changes

* `KafkaStreamBrancher` has been updated to use the new `split()` and `branch()` methods instead of the deprecated `branch()` method
* The `DeserializationExceptionHandler` has been updated to use the new `ErrorHandlerContext`

[[x40-internal-api-updates]]
=== Internal API Updates related to Apache Kafka 4.0.0

* The `BrokerAddress` class now uses `org.apache.kafka.server.network.BrokerEndPoint` instead of the deprecated `kafka.cluster.BrokerEndPoint`
* The `GlobalEmbeddedKafkaTestExecutionListener` has been updated to work solely with KRaft mode

[[x40-new-consumer-rebalance-protocol]]
=== New Consumer Rebalance Protocol

Spring for Apache Kafka 4.0 supports Kafka 4.0â€™s new consumer rebalance protocol - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-848%3A+The+Next+Generation+of+the+Consumer+Rebalance+Protocol[KIP-848].
For details, see xref:kafka/receiving-messages/rebalance-listeners.adoc#new-rebalance-protocol[New Consumer Rebalance Protocol docs].

[[x40-multi-value-header]]
=== Support multi-value header

The `DefaultKafkaHeaderMapper` and `SimpleKafkaHeaderMapper` support multi-value header mapping for Kafka records.
More details are available in xref:kafka/headers.adoc#multi-value-header[Support multi-value header mapping].

[[x40-add-record-interceptor]]
=== Configure additional `RecordInterceptor`

Listener containers now support interceptor customization via `getRecordInterceptor()`.
See the xref:kafka/receiving-messages/message-listener-container.adoc#message-listener-container[Message Listener Containers] section for details.

[[x40-batch-observability]]
=== Per-Record Observation in Batch Listeners

It is now possible to get an observation for each record when using a batch listener.
See xref:kafka/micrometer.adoc#batch-listener-obs[Observability for Batch Listeners] for more information.
